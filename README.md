# bird-song-id

Identifies bird species based on recordings of vocalizations

Much credit is owed to Dr. Czeba and Dr. Tóth for their work on bird song classification for the BirdCLEF 2016 competition. An enormous part of this project is based entirely on their work here:

To aid in data collection, I created an API wrapper for the xeno-canto.org recording database to retrieve JSON metadata and MP3 recordings based on user search criteria.
